This is a simple program to demonstrate loading of HSLIC data. Given a label-map file and a scale 
it will output a ppm file with each superpixel given a random color.

Usage: 
      HSLIC_demo input_file.mat output_file.ppm scale
Where:
      input_file.mat is a label-map file
      output_file.ppm is the location to store the resulting image
      scale is the scale in pixels of the superpixels.
